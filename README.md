Introduction 


Food is one of the basic needs in life. We cannot cook dinner on time because of our busy schedules, and we are also tired of going to a restaurant, eating, and then returning. Instead, you might utilize the app to have excellent home cooked food delivered to your house from a range of options. FoodMama is a homemade food-on-demand app that aims to revolutionize the way people order and receive food and not to miss your home. In this era where we crave for homemade meals, this app serves as the Airbnb for food. This is an All-in-One solution from referring a recipe to ordering the cooked meal, not only this, but you can also register your meal recipes, share with others, and earn credits as well.
